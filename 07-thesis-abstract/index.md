# Thesis abstract - Fictional alternative festival of electronic dance music (EDM)
This paper focuses on a fictional alternative festival of electronic dance music. 
The main goal is to make a working design system and visual identity, that will represent an alternative approach to a festival of electronic dance music. 
I will be working with targeting a very specific part of the market, more specificaly the newcommers scene. 
This festival will give opportunities for those, who are talented and hard working in the music field, being great DJ's, making music or are vocally blessed,
but have no way of promoting themselfs and getting their name out in the market.

This festival is using the advances of new technology while working with the visual design,
using the elements of the "future", like in cyberpunk visual style, while using the techniques and ideas of graphic design, like grunge, such as David Carson.
The goal is to reach a specific target group with a very memorable design, while simultaniously catching and eye and be attractive.

To expand possibilities of the festival, a big part of the work will be an app,
that will be closely connected to the whole working operation of the system.
The app gives many advantages, such as a map with live feed of the action going around the festival,
storing tickets and giving you the opportunity to take a closer look at the potentional of newcommers,
that will be or can be on stage during the festival.

## Final version used in my actual bachelor thesis
My bachelor thesis is a visual style for a fictitious alternative electronic music festival. The main goal of the festival is to support talented musical artists who do not have the means to become famous.

In the theoretical part I will explain the basics of electronic music or EDM. I will analyze the music festival market here in the Czech Republic and abroad. Subsequently, I analyze the market of music festivals with a similar theme of supporting talented unknown artists. Then I will explain the techniques that will make me want to create my visual communication. Finally, I will create a questionnaire to discover public opinion and confirm the expected target group.

In the practical part, I will present the results of the questionnaire and determine the target group. Subsequently, I will introduce the concept of visual communication. I will describe the corporate identity of the festival and explain its graphic elements such as cyberpunk and the theme of creation. This will be followed by a presentation of the visual style for communication on social media. Furthermore, the practical part will include promotion of the performers, printed materials, tickets and advertising items. I also designed an application that is connected to the festival, and has features such as live streaming of the stage, purchase and storage of tickets, a map for orientation and the ability to look up the work of musical artists.
