I was born in very young age. Now 22 years old, Im living between my hometown and “school-town.”

I don’t take design as just work or a subject in school. I love designing, giving things some face and making a visual style to things that want to shine.

Through out my time in graphic design, I discovered my love for presentation and idea making, leading me to my hope-to-be future work - creative director.

Apart from the design thing, my love for video games is no suprise. Have been playing and always will be (sorry mom and future wife, no changing that).

Something useful on the other hand, my passion for music has lead me to an amaizing hobby that just costs me a few hours of my sleep. DJ! I love to make a crowd dance to tunes that I blast and to make people smile and sing. It just warms my heart in a different way.

Currently, Im a student at VŠKK university in Prague. My study of graphic design has been going on for 7 years, and will continue until there is no knowledge left.

As of work speaking, freelancing is the main way. In my opinion, I have done a real broad field of work, so Im not affraid and excited to see, what you want to create!

I enjoy and preferably work in Adobe Creative Cloud. Lately i have been working in Figma, which I really enjoy. As a graphic designer, im kind of obligated to work in this enviroment. But it doesn’t bother me, Im used to it and have studied my whole time in these, so I can label myself as kind of oriented in this. In meantime and if the works requieres it I work with my iPad in Procreate, that lets me draw on free will, like on paper!
