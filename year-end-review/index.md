# Year End Review

1) What did you like most about this course?

I can say that I liked everything. You taught us many things in many subjects, and, for what I'm the most gratefull for, is that all of them are usefull in the future.

2) What did you like least about this course?

It wasn't completly a "you" mistake, but when I was tired, watching 30 minute videos was kind of... It was slow. But that is completly my fault.

3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

That having a personality in my writing is a very improtant thing. Next is probably the fact that having a different approach to things is sometimes <i> bombastic </i>. And lastly, having alot of it is not the key. The key is to be informative, truthfull and to give out your context in the most understandable way possible.

4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

For me, it was the thesis presentation. Due to the fact that it was made at 4 am in the morning, that is something that I can surely call "a memorable activity."

5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

I'm of course proud of finishing my bachelor thesis. But in the english subject, I must say that stading my ground and explaining the problem of "self-critique," that i chose for my storytelling presentation. It was a big step talking about this topic openly and Im glad Justin was supportive in those times.

6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?

That having an positive mindset is the bare minimum for accomplishment. You need to try things, and you need to have an open and happy mind to do so.

7) What’s one thing you could have done better?

Probably be more active. Justin, you gave us all you got, and I feel like sometimes, there were moments where we didn't look like we appriciate you enough.

8) What’s one thing I could have done better?

Nothing. You are a perfect example of a teacher in my eyes. You engage us in coversations, in activities. You have an open mind for our ideas, for our lazy minds. You are avaiable in off-school times. You prepare stuff that is interesting AND important. I wish at least half of my teachers in the past were at least half as fun to work with as with you.

9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?

This, I don't know. Because I feel like I learned so much, but at the same time, looking at your energy, I'm just curious what else you are able to do! I personally wouldn't add anything, but if I knew what there were, I would 100% add it!

10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

Enjoy every moment, work on every task, talk with Justin, don't miss a single class. Every moment with Justin is a completly different experience then with other teachers, and it's something you will remember. If it's the school part, or the personal one, it's worth every second.
