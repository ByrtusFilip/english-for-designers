<i> Welcome, design-seekers </i>

Currently, Im a student at VŠKK university in Prague. My study of graphic 
design has been going on for 7 years, and will continue until there is no 
knowledge left.

As of work speaking, freelancing is the main way. In my opinion, I have done a 
real broad field of work, so Im not affraid and excited to see, what you want to 
create!

<i>Something about me you ask? Alrighty then </i>

I was born in very young age. Now 22 years old, Im living between my 
hometown and “school-town.”


I don’t take design as just work or a subject in school. I love designing, giving 
things some face and making a visual style to things that want to shine.


Through out my time in graphic design, I discovered my love for presentation 
and idea making, leading me to my hope-to-be future work - creative director.


Apart from the design thing, my love for video games is no suprise. Have been 
playing and always will be (sorry mom and future wife, no changing that).


Something useful on the other hand, my passion for music has lead me to an 
amaizing hobby that just costs me a few hours of my sleep. DJ! I love to make 
a crowd dance to tunes that I blast and to make people smile and sing. It just 
warms my heart in a different way.
