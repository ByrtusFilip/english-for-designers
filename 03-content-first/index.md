<h2> <i> Welcome, design-seekers </i> </h2>

Currently, Im a student at VŠKK university in Prague. My study of graphic 
design has been going on for 7 years, and will continue until there is no 
knowledge left.

As of work speaking, freelancing is the main way. In my opinion, I have done a 
real broad field of work, so Im not affraid and excited to see, what you want to 
create!

I enjoy and preferably work in Adobe Creative Cloud. Lately i have been working in Figma, which I really enjoy.
As a graphic designer, im kind of obligated to work in this enviroment. But it doesn't bother me, Im used to it and have studied my whole time in these, so I can label myself as <i> kind of oriented </i> in this.
In meantime and if the works requieres it I work with my iPad in Procreate, that lets me draw on free will, like on paper!


<h2> <i>Something about me you ask? Alrighty then </i> </h2>

I was born in very young age. Now 22 years old, Im living between my 
hometown and “school-town.”


I don’t take design as just work or a subject in school. I love designing, giving 
things some face and making a visual style to things that want to shine.


Through out my time in graphic design, I discovered my love for presentation 
and idea making, leading me to my hope-to-be future work - creative director.


Apart from the design thing, my love for video games is no suprise. Have been 
playing and always will be (sorry mom and future wife, no changing that).


Something useful on the other hand, my passion for music has lead me to an 
amaizing hobby that just costs me a few hours of my sleep. DJ! I love to make 
a crowd dance to tunes that I blast and to make people smile and sing. It just 
warms my heart in a different way.

<h2> <i> You want to see some work? Ok then! </i> </h2>


Some background:


Company: Yashica s.r.o.

Type of work: Internship work

Client: BlueGarpo

Task: Create logo

Deadline: 2 days

Instructions: “Show what we do in the logo”


One day, at my internship, there wasn’t much to do, so for the first time, our 
company executive called me to try something.

There was a project that has been sitting idle for a long time; 

<b> the BlueGarpo project. </b>


Make a logo for a company, simple enough, what could go wrong?

<i> Oh boy was i wrong... </i>

It was just a simple logo, nothing else, but the problem was in the assignement 
of the instructions... “Make the logo so it represents what we do.”

Sounds reasonable, pretty usual actually. Was it as simple as everything else?

<i> I couldn’t be more far from the truth... </i>

Here is the problem, the company was <i> (takes a deep breath) </i>

<i> provides clients with a comprehensive service in the area of ​sale and lease of real 
estate, representation of clients in auctions and comprehensive accounting, tax and legal 
advice, including management and debt collection.
Installation of windows and seals.
Preparation of building materials with the possibility of 
help from experts on the insulation of residential units.
Service of agricultural machinery, sale of seeds and fertilizers. Garden decoration expert 
advice, lawnmoving services, preparation of gardens for ponds and water systems. </i>

<right> <i> yea </i> </right>

So there i was, consulting with every person that was in the company...


First i started by sketching some ideas, that lead nowhere because I was 
physicaly unable to create one symbol that would represent all... that.


So I started working with just text, simple use of “if it doesn’t show what it is, 

it can’t do any harm.

That didn’t work because obviously it was againts the requirements of the task.

So next me and one of my co-workers came up with an idea of “if they do 
everything, just point to everything.”


So I started working, creating variations, one improved from the other.

This actually proved to be a success, which our boss approved and after some 
more consultation, we agreed to send this.
