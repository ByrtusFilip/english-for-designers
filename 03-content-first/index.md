Currently, Im a student at VÅ KK university in Prague. My study of graphic 
design has been going on for 7 years, and will continue until there is no 
knowledge left.

As of work speaking, freelancing is the main way. In my opinion, I have done a 
real broad field of work, so Im not affraid and excited to see, what you want to 
create!

My field of expertise:
