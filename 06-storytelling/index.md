Self-critique vs Self-destruction

Imagine this scenario... You are working hard, long hours, but finally, you make it. Your dream work came true.

You are proud of yourself. You achieved what you started.

And then it begins. The doubt, the thoughts, the idea of failure.

That little voice you hear, is your <b>self-critique.</b>

Your self-critique should look like a distinguished version of yourself, but no. It probably looks like a little green goblin #&!@ that is just pure hatred.

Self-critique can be divided into a few common forms.

First, there is 
### lack of confidence. 
You can lack confidence because of recent fails or unachieved goals. 

*Don't ya worry my guy.

Good work will come. Everyone has ups and downs and noone is perfect all day everday. Be patient, try new things, get your mind on the right path.
Adapt to your mistakes. Fails and mistakes are not something to be affraid of. Due to mistakes, you learn paths that work for you. You learn from them. You use them to your advantage.

Lastly, stop comparing yourself to others.

In the art department, its really hard to find a difference between feedback and hatred. But its an important lesson. Good people don't mean you no harm, and certainly don't want to insult you. Take their notes as an opportunity to grow.

*but how do I stop this comparing?

Try this. Tunnel vision. When you are working (and you will, from some time to all the time) ina group, don't look at others work. Everyone has their own ideas and own minds, we all work differently and have different views and opinions on things. Focus on yours, you are the creator, you are the one who will show others what he made.
